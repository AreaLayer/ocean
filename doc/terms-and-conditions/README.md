## Terms and Conditions
The file `latest.txt` contains a sample for terms and conditions. The same terms are hardcoded in the `GetGenesisContractHash()` method to allow consistent genesis block creation.

The latest contract should be stored at `$DATADIR/terms-and-conditions/latest.txt` on all signing nodes to allow block creation with the latest terms. The hash of this contract will be required to verify addresses under the BIP175 protocol.

The contract will also have to be distributed to any external node/wallet clients run by users in order to be embedded to a new address generated by the wallet. External clients will be able to verify that the terms are up to date by comparing them to the result of the `getcontracthash` RPC call.
